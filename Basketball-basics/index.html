                Basketball is a fast-paced team sport played on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop mounted 10 feet high at each end of the court. It is one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.

                Invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, basketball has evolved from a simple game with peach baskets into a global phenomenon. It requires a combination of athleticism, strategy, and skill, making it exciting for both players and spectators.

            <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
            <p>
                The game is played between two teams of five players each. Points are scored by shooting the ball through the opponent's basket. Different shots are worth different amounts of points: 2 points for a standard field goal, 3 points for shots from beyond the arc, and 1 point for a free throw.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>No Traveling:</strong> A player cannot take more than two steps without dribbling the ball.</li>
                <li><strong>No Double Dribble:</strong> Once a player stops dribbling, they cannot start again; they must pass or shoot.</li>
                <li><strong>Fouls:</strong> Personal contact usually results in a foul. Excess fouls can lead to disqualification.</li>
                <li><strong>Shot Clock:</strong> Teams have a limited time (usually 24 seconds) to attempt a shot.</li>
                <li><strong>Out of Bounds:</strong> If the ball or the player with the ball touches the line or outside, possession changes.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Player Positions</h3>
            <p>
                Each player on the court typically has a specific role and position. While modern basketball is becoming more fluid ("positionless"), the traditional five positions remain a core concept.
